# Redux Counter

Demonstrates using Redux library to create a simple counter app that increments and decrements a number on the screen. Written in ES5 so no need for Babel or extra compiling. Intentionally left out React or any other libraries or frameworks to highlight Redux on its own. Numbered comments in the code to show the Redux pattern.
